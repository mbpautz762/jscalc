# jscalc
The Odin Project JS Fundamentals.

This is a super simple calculator for the JS fundamentals course portion of The Odin Project.  It uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML only.

it ain't much, but it's honest work.

current issues:
1) decimals don't work yet, but the underlying code will make it simple to implement.
2) it's boring.  it needs some spcicing up (styling and functionality)
3) no advanced features, but they aren't required by this exercise
