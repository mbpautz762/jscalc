The Odin Project JS Fundamentals.

This is a super simple calculator for the JS fundamentals course portion of The Odin Project.  It uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML only.

it ain't much, but it's honest work.

current issues:
1) it's boring.  it needs some spicing up (styling and functionality) to make it more interesting
2) no advanced features, but they aren't required by this exercise
